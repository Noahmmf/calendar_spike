# Calendar spike

Goal of this project is to face the hardest aspect of my solo project- HeartSync. The most challengeing aspect of the Calendar is syncing two schedules on the same page.

## Initial thoughts/ideass

1. Have the "household" SQL table share one calendar.
    - How do I make their data show up? 
    - How can I do that in this project? 
2. Find a working Calendar that I can impliment into my project
    - Daily view of time slots(side by side)
    -  *** How do I show both schedules at once?**
3. Is this something I can realistically do? 
    - time commitment-
    - Obsticles
4. How can I connect a DB to each "household"?
    - What is needed for everything to be saved in the DB?
        - start and stop time/ all day


## Fullcalendar
https://fullcalendar.io/

Fullcalendar is a calendar for react projects that is highly customizable. I plan to use the free version for my project. 

## Testing

I have created this repository to test out Fullcalendar. Initially very overwhelming and hard to understand what is needed. I finally got a calendar to render on the screen after 2 hours.
